Short Development Flow for Blockchain-based Land Title Registry Project

1. Define Concept & Requirements
   - Objective: Digitize and secure land ownership records on blockchain.
   - Core features: property registration, ownership transfer, document verification, and fraud prevention.
   - Choose blockchain: Ethereum, Polygon, or Hyperledger (for private networks).

2. Design System Architecture
   - Frontend: React.js
   - Backend: Node.js / Express
   - Smart Contracts: Solidity (for Ethereum-compatible chains) or Chaincode (for Hyperledger)
   - Database: IPFS (for document storage) + PostgreSQL/MongoDB (for metadata and user info)

3. Develop Smart Contracts
   - Core contracts:
     - LandRegistryContract (stores property details and ownership)
     - TransferContract (handles ownership change)
     - VerificationContract (for legal or government authority validation)
   - Functions: registerLand(), verifyOwner(), transferOwnership(), viewLandRecord()

4. Integrate Frontend with Blockchain
   - Connect through Web3.js / Ethers.js
   - Enable wallet authentication via MetaMask or other wallets.
   - Allow users to search and view property data from blockchain.

5. Implement Backend Logic
   - Handle KYC, document verification, and off-chain data storage.
   - Integrate APIs for authority validation and geo-mapping if required.

6. Testing
   - Perform unit testing using Hardhat/Truffle or Fabric test tools.
   - Use testnets (Goerli/Polygon Mumbai) for deployment and simulation.
   - Conduct thorough smart contract audit.

7. Deployment
   - Deploy contracts on mainnet or private blockchain.
   - Host frontend using Vercel/Netlify.
   - Run backend services on AWS, Azure, or Render.

8. Launch & Monitor
   - Enable dashboards for authorities to track registered properties.
   - Add analytics, logging, and periodic updates.
   - Optionally integrate DAO for governance or community land management.
